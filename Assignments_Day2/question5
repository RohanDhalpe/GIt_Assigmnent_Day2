Q5. Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also
 you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?

-> --force and --force-with-lease are both opiton are used with git push when you need
     to forcefully update the code on remote repo 

    -- force : 
                when we used --force with git push it means you are telling to git to ignore what 
       is on the remote server and just push your changes even if it means overwriting or erasing 
       what is already there

    command :
                git push --force origin branch_name


    
    --force-with-lease :
  git --force-with-lease
- suppose different people p1,p2 are working on project
- p1 has created the repository and p2 has cloned the repository
- p2 ahs pushed some changes to the same branch
- p1 performs some local commit and which can overwrite the changes of p2
- then --force-with-lease will not allow to push the changes
