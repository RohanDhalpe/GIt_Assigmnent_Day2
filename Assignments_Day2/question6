Q6. How to un stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.
Ans->
    To unstage chnages from the staging area in git you can use
    command :
              git reset file_name
 
    
    This above command is useful for the only particular file. It you want to do for all file then 
    you have to use 
   
    command : 
              git reset .   
   
    If we have to do the number of changes then
    command : 
             
git reset Head fileName (to reset changes to the file)
git reset HEAD^1
